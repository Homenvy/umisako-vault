# Log - September 23, 2025

## Initial Vault Setup
- Created `umisako-vault` structure:
  - `/projects` with initial subfolders for three major ongoing projects.
  - `/shared` for templates and diagrams.
  - `/logs` for tracking historical updates.
- Added core documentation (`index.md`, README files).

## Next Step
- Begin migrating existing project files and diagrams into their respective folders.
- Establish commit message style guide for consistency.
